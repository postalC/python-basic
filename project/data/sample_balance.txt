@NespressoUSA Hi having trouble with your milk frother. Looked all over for solution and failed. Blinking red light. Thank you!	&&negative
.@WilliamsSonoma I just went from having the best experience to the absolute worst... cc: .@NespressoUSA	&&negative
i find that the coffee is excellent but when you need a part for the machine it takes for ever.	&&negative
i needed and aspirator part for the milk and you didn't even have them.  they were in back order and you didn't know when you would get them.  we have to phone nespresso back every week to find out when they will be coming in.	&&negative
i ordered in u.k. and got them right away.  part service is bad and you should work on that.  it is terrible thinking you can't get better service in the u.k. and that you can't give that kind of service here.	&&negative
my last 2 orders the collection never happened, and this time i haven't been delivered any recycling bags (ordered 2).	&&negative
the motor / axel in the milk machine is jammed and doesn't stir the cold milk. this causes only the milk at the very bottom to heat. this in turn causes the heating element to switch off. the rest of the cold milk on top when stirred with the warm milk on the bottom remains cold.	&&negative
hi tried it but that link only allows me to buy capsules not machines. there's no option to select machines :(	&&negative
purchased my pixie last october. tried changing the water volume, that didn't work too well so i changed it back to factory settings. it works ok and makes great coffee, but the noise when it makes the coffee is so much louder than it was before i changed the volume that i need go to another room until the coffee is ready. why is that and can anything be done to reduce the loud noise when it pours?	&&negative
would like to share the love on valentines day but despite constant asking i am still trying to get my 70 pound voucher from you that was part of my purchase deal back in october.	&&negative
nespresso you people take the utter piss! ...got a credit for xmas to spend on coffee to go with my machine (first time have ever owned a coffee machine!) ...called up a few times as wasn't on my account...finally after about 4 calls they realised it had been put into my dads account (that was fine so transferred it) it then went into another wrong account...i was patient and got it after another week and the guy on the phone said something about a good will gesture....two weeks ago i spent it and noticed there was a little bit more in our account (which i obviously assumed it was from the guy who said good will gesture) ... order came well half of it so had to call again and get it sent out again as they forgot to pack it! ...today letter comes through saying you owe Âí‚£29 for coffee we haven't paid for what!? now apparently unless i remember the date and time i called you and spoke to that person (bearing in mind i've been on the phone to you guys more than my family members the last few weeks) you wont do anything!....thanks ....will just use instant from now on i think with that kind of service!	&&negative
after many weeks of calls, unanswered emails, and getting passed around, there is still no sign of my free voucher from nespresso that was offered when i got my machine at christmas. it's beyond frustrating. if you plan to offer something like this to customers, don't make it so difficult for them to apply for it.	&&negative
which coffee - because the coffee is great, to choose for this morning cold cup of coffee. a shame the nespresso maschine only makes cold coffee!!!	&&negative
you promise 2 day delivery and then you don't ship 	&&negative
remedy suggested was to ship order again but i would also have to pay again	&&negative
done. thank you for following up. please let me know when someone is coming. please tell them to avoid further disappointment by bringing the replacement with them. i do not want to have to reply saying that you guys removed the device for another 2 weeks!	&&negative

hi, are you still recycling capsules in the uk?	&&question
what is your favourite nespresso pod marika aspland?	&&question
just some feedback for you from a uk nespresso owner who enjoys trying selection packs and sharing pods with my friends. why is it that some of the pods are not labelled (with the name on the foil part) while some are?  it makes it quite hard to identify pods sometimes, especially when the colours are similar or pods are not in the brochure,	&&question
is there any chance of being able to be sent a trial pack (or even just one pod) of the cioccorosso? i don't live near any local nespressos and don't feel up to purchasing a full pack in case i don't enjoy it!	&&question
hi. thanks for that. can i do this (ie: buy starter pack and put in an order for the free discovery box) at your london store as i would like to collect the grand crus today?	&&question
hello plz i want the email address of france branch yrgently	&&question
hi, online on which country site? as the us one does ship to india, i tried checking out but it only let me enter us states not india? please advise	&&question
and you know i don't know my member number can you check that out via my e mailadress?	&&question
hello :-) could someone please contact me regarding the device that heats up the milk. my member number is 510009 it seems to be burning in one area. i will send a photo.  thank you.	&&question
hi! wanted to know where i can buy a nespresso machine in india!? i was living in london recently and got so hooked onto the nespresso there. anywhere i could buy online that may ship? please advise	&&question
kazaar is out of stock!! will it be back??	&&question
how much do you have to spend on capsules to get free delivery or isn't this an option ?	&&question
are the nespresso capsule recycling bin/container available still? i would love one! p.s. got my machine in december last year, top class coffee and fantastic customer service! any offers coming about soon?	&&question
why are they different?  don't you want a capsule from home to be used in the business machine?  or is the "business" machine made to dispense for sale?	&&question
what's the price difference between home machines and 'business'. what's the major difference between machines?	&&question

purchased my pixie last october. tried changing the water volume, that didn't work too well so i changed it back to factory settings. it works ok and makes great coffee, but the noise when it makes the coffee is so much louder than it was before i changed the volume that i need go to another room until the coffee is ready. why is that and can anything be done to reduce the loud noise when it pours?	&&negative
would like to share the love on valentines day but despite constant asking i am still trying to get my 70 pound voucher from you that was part of my purchase deal back in october.	&&negative
nespresso you people take the utter piss! ...got a credit for xmas to spend on coffee to go with my machine (first time have ever owned a coffee machine!) ...called up a few times as wasn't on my account...finally after about 4 calls they realised it had been put into my dads account (that was fine so transferred it) it then went into another wrong account...i was patient and got it after another week and the guy on the phone said something about a good will gesture....two weeks ago i spent it and noticed there was a little bit more in our account (which i obviously assumed it was from the guy who said good will gesture) ... order came well half of it so had to call again and get it sent out again as they forgot to pack it! ...today letter comes through saying you owe √•‚Äô√¢¬£29 for coffee we haven't paid for what!? now apparently unless i remember the date and time i called you and spoke to that person (bearing in mind i've been on the phone to you guys more than my family members the last few weeks) you wont do anything!....thanks ....will just use instant from now on i think with that kind of service!	&&negative
after many weeks of calls, unanswered emails, and getting passed around, there is still no sign of my free voucher from nespresso that was offered when i got my machine at christmas. it's beyond frustrating. if you plan to offer something like this to customers, don't make it so difficult for them to apply for it.	&&negative
which coffee - because the coffee is great, to choose for this morning cold cup of coffee. a shame the nespresso maschine only makes cold coffee!!!	&&negative
you promise 2 day delivery and then you don't ship 	&&negative
remedy suggested was to ship order again but i would also have to pay again	&&negative
done. thank you for following up. please let me know when someone is coming. please tell them to avoid further disappointment by bringing the replacement with them. i do not want to have to reply saying that you guys removed the device for another 2 weeks!	&&negative
